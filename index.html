    <p id="me">Thanks for testing that 👍 
    Since you installed the Realtek<span class="bold"> LAN </span> driver and restarted, but <span class="bolder">Ethernet</span> still
    doesn’t appear, that tells us something deeper: either Windows isn’t detecting
    the hardware at all,
    or the port is disabled.</p>

    <p>⚠️ If after all this you still don’t see Ethernet in Device Manager and
     the port has no lights, then it’s likely a hardware failure (dead LAN port) 
     — which would require Lenovo service or using a USB-C to Ethernet adapter
     as a workaround.</p>
